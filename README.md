# Turbopoly
A final I did for my intro to java class, then continued it through Structure of programming 1's final.

It's a take off a board game, "Monopoly", which I know is trademarked, but for a final in a CSCI class, one has no intentions to publish this work for commercial use. 

The first project was nearly 4k lines of code, and taking what we learned in Structure 1, that code is reduced to around 1.5k.

Currently it's in a .zip file, so all you must do is download / extrect it to any location on the harddisk, then import the project into eclipse.

RunGame.java is the class you run to see the game work.
