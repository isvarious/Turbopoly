# Turbopoly
A final I did for my intro to java class, then continued it through Structure of programming 1's final.

It's a take off a board game, "Monopoly", which I know is trademarked, but for a final in a CSCI class, one has no intentions to publish this work for commercial use. 

The first project was nearly 4k lines of code, and taking what we learned in Structure 1, that code is reduced to around 1.5k.
